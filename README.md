# DO-RE-MI
The main goal of this project is to provide the students with necessary mainstream instruments. This project will help students to be familiarised with musical instruments and learn all the key nodes before playing on the actual instrument.
The recent global pandemic has drastic effect on the students wanting to learn different musical instruments. Moreover, due to pandemics, the students are not being able to access the desired musical instruments. So the students who want to learn musical instruments during the pandemic but are unable to do so. As a result, they give up on their dreams. Through this project I want them to realize their dreams.
The basic requirement of this project to run in your machines are:
1. intallation of Python
2. A web-cam
3. in your command prompt just have to type pip install opencv-python
4. another library you need is imutils so write in your command prompt pip install imutils
5. another library you need is playsound so write in your command prompt pip install playsound
6. another library you need is pygame so write in your command prompt pip install pygame

So how to play the drums. The program will access the camera from the user's computer. A drumset will be displayed and whenever the user brings in their drumstick the program will start tracking the tip of the drumstick. Now the tips will have to be of red and blue colour for the program to detect.Then whenever the tip of the drumstick comes in contact with any of the drums the sound of that particular drum will be played through the speakers.
Now lets see for the piano and the xylophone. The program will access the camera from the user's computer. Then the user have to put their hand inside the frame and the program will start to detect the hands of the user. Now to play the sound the user have to put his tip of the index finger inside any key and that note will play through the speakers.
